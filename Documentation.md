## Summary

A healthy and balanced diet is integral towards developing minds and concentration. However, despite this nearly 33% of all school aged children fail to receive a balanced and healthy diet whilst at school according to a study conducted by the New York Times (2015). Further, of the 68% who do get a healthy lunch, based upon a study by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 25% of them even bother to eat it all (Medical Daily, 2014).

Taking this into consideration the team, ‘Frying Nemo’, is dedicated towards developing and implementing an application which establish a connection between parents and teachers in creating and maintaining a meal plan for children easily, healthily and above all tasty.

## Process

Applying key social and mobile computing concepts team ‘Frying Nemo’, has created the beginning of an interesting application known as ‘MunchBox’.
MunchBox is a community driven mobile application which aims to deliver mobile social interaction between parents, their children and teachers. That is, to collectively contribute their own recipes and opinions on lunch packing for their children. Furthermore, the application attempts to foster interaction between the child and the parent in planning and preparing healthy and fun snacks to consume throughout the day, and through that potentially educate and train them in healthy eating habits.

Given the picky eating habits of young children, this application allows parents to create recipes by looking up specific ingredients, or search for healthy recipes shared in the community. The application also performs as an educational tool for children. The interactive screen fostering both a close interaction between parent and child as well as educating them in healthy eating habits and establishing basic knowledge of common ingredients (fruit, vegetables, meat etc.). Once the parent/child has chosen their recipes for the week/day the application will also  automatically generate a shopping list of relevant ingredients, adding a further useful tool to the application’s belt.

## Development Breakdown

The original concept was built initially around education. That is, ensuring that children ate a healthy and well-balanced lunch whilst they were outside their parents watchful eye and under the school’s supervision.

The original concept, however, didn’t feel to have a strong enough connection to the education field alone. Further, there were already applications which did the same basic functionality if not marketed towards the more limited scope that ‘MunchBox’ was designed around. That is, measuring and managing children’s consumption throughout the week and returning them the results of this on a regular basis.

> Early conceptualisations of ‘MunchBox’ focused primarily on measuring children's food consumption throughout the week.
The application then developed into the community field. With an introduction and focus upon a large scale community driven recipe database which allowed users to share, like and subscribe to various recipes. These recipes could be searched for using keywords and allowed users to search for recipes which included or excluded certain ingredients based upon their child’s preferences or allergies.
These changes were tested against a group of participants from nearby schools who matched the user criteria we had established in our initial persona’s

A series of mockups were constructed based upon this feedback by various members of the team, ‘Frying Nemo’.

 Based upon feedback and general discussion amongst group members ‘Version Two’ was selected as the preferred version. After paper prototyping primarily amongst the friends and family to establish ease of use and flow, work began on a more developed functioning prototype. This was helped through re-examining the pre-existing user persona’s developed in the early days of the project's conception. The new persona’s were used as a means of refocusing the application towards the user’s needs and requirements.

> Revised Persona’s
This refinement process led to the eventual development of the most recent prototype: https://munch-box.appspot.com/login
Despite the considerable change and development that has occurred throughout this course, there are still several limitations within the current design which need to be considered for future development. First, the design and implementation of the search bar needs serious thought. The main component within the application it needs to clearly and easily allow users to search for various recipes which may or may not contain certain ingredients. Allowing for parents to find recipes which cater towards their child’s picky eating habits or various allergies.

Second the means in which parents communicate within the recipes needs to be considered. The current prototype fails to consider this component and is a severe limitation/weakness. I was planned to add a like and subscribe functionality. With users being able to track the contributions of other users whose recipes they enjoy.
Overall, the development of the application, ‘MunchBox’ is moving along quite well, but several elements still need to be considered in order to release a more well rounded and received application.

## Feature

* Recipe creating and sharing
   * Users (parents, children and teachers) will be able to create recipe for the child’s lunchbox and even share the recipe to the community for other users, should they wish.
* Nutrition Calculation
   * Approximation of nutrition data will be automatically calculated when a recipe is created to give user a better visualisation of the nutrition value of the meal.This nutritional data will be collated and a visual representation of the users calorie intake and nutritional breakdown will be able to be displayed to them at any given time.
* Shopping List
   * Relevant ingredients of each saved recipe will be automatically generated in a shopping list to assist users in better preparing for their upcoming lunches.
* Ingredient Library
   * Provides graphic representation and basic knowledge of categorized ingredients for kids to study in order to get them involved in preparing their lunch.
* User Profiles
   * Allow for multiple users to access and make use of the application. Their data being transferable across their account.
